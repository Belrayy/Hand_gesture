That's a fun and creative gesture set! Since you're working on gesture-based PC control, here's a set of **practical or playful ideas** for each gesture. I’ve kept a mix of **utility**, **fun visuals**, and **possible media actions**, depending on the vibe you're going for:

---

### 📹 **Recording / Control**
- **Open Hand** – Stop Recording  
- **Fist** – Start / Resume Recording  

---

### 👍 **Reactions & Emojis**
- **Thumbs Up** – Display a 👍 like icon  
- **Peace Sign** – Display ✌️ or a peace animation  
- **Victory (same as Peace with palm out)** – Display animated “Victory!” popup  

---

### 🎬 **Media / Interface Control**
- **Pointing** – Full screen preview toggle  
- **Flat Hand (palm facing down)** – Mute / Unmute system volume  
- **Closed Fist with Pointing Index** – Switch camera view or focus (like “click”)  

---

### 🤘 **Fun / Stylized Gestures**
- **Spider-Man (Middle + Ring finger bent)** – Fire web animation or trigger a “special effect”  
- **Rock-on (Index + Pinky)** – Trigger music mode / play a guitar riff sound  
- **Okay (Thumb + Index forming O)** – Confirm action / success animation  

---

### 📞 **Communication-Inspired**
- **Call Me (thumb + pinky extended)** – Launch communication app (Zoom, Discord, Skype, etc.)  
- **Phone (Flat hand sideways near ear)** – Display mock incoming call UI  

---

### 👐 **Numerical Gestures**
- **Number Three** – Switch to third saved layout / scene  
- **Number Four** – Trigger “multi-window” layout or launch four favorite apps  

---

### ✨ **Miscellaneous / Stylized**
- **Index and Middle Finger Crossed** – Trigger “luck” or fortune-teller visual  
- **Gun (thumb up, index pointing out)** – Take a snapshot / screenshot
